# Create a new Activity for the Movie details
To show the details of a movie selected by the user after concluding the search conducted by the user, we are going to create a new Activity, called `MovieDetailsActivity`, that will be responsible for displaying such information.

Using Android Studio, simply create a new "Empty Activity" and name it `MovieDetailsActivity` (the name is not important... I'm just using this one because of the coherence with the source-code sample provided in this project).

After the new Activity is created, you may advance for the next step - Designing the layout of the two activities.
