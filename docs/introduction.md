# Introdution
The objective of the following documentation is to allow the user to understand the different 
steps that were performed to obtain the final project.

This sample depends on Volley for the network API calls and [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) to 
download and show the images. Moreover, this project uses the awesome [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com)
that allows the usage of their own API to get information about movies.
